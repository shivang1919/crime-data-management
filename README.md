# crime-data-management
In India there is no central crime record management system. Our motive is to bring crime records , missing person bureau online and accessible to common citizens.
Our team is hacklite and team members are Shivang Sharma , Shubham Kumar Sinha , Vishal Poddar and Srishti Chhavi.
We have used mern stack .
We have divided website users into two parts users and police police have the authority to post new fir and missing person reports . 
Users can check their fir status and search for missing persons and they have report a crime option.
